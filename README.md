```markdown
# Factorio Prometheus Exporter Docker Compose Setup

## Description

This Docker Compose configuration sets up a Prometheus exporter for monitoring Factorio servers. The exporter is based on a Python script that fetches server status from the Factorio multiplayer API and exposes metrics in Prometheus format.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Docker Compose installed on your system

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Factorio-Just-For-Fun/factorio-prometheus-exporter.git
   cd factorio-prometheus-exporter/
   ```

2. **Create a `config.yaml` file:**

   ```bash
   cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
   ```

   Update `config.yaml` with your Factorio credentials and any other configuration needed.

3. **Build and run the Docker containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image and start the containers defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

4. **Access Prometheus metrics:**

   Once the containers are running, you can access Prometheus metrics from your browser or using tools like `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
   ```

   Replace `localhost` with your Docker host IP if accessing from a remote machine.

## Configuration

Modify `config.yaml` to adjust Factorio credentials (`factorio_username` and `factorio_token`), specify the `external_ip` (leave empty for dynamic fetching), and set the `ports` to monitor.

Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Factorio configuration
factorio_username: your factorio username
factorio_token: your factorio token
external_ip: ""  # Leave empty to fetch dynamically or specify an IP

ports:
  - your game port
# - your game ports	#for multiple server on one ip
# - your game ports	#for multiple server on one ip
# - your game ports	#for multiple server on one ip
```

## Notes

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed and configured on your system.
- Adjust the ports in `docker-compose.yml` if necessary to match your desired setup.
- This setup assumes the Docker containers will expose and run the Prometheus exporter on port `9100` as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Make sure to replace placeholders like `your factorio username` and `your factorio token` with actual credentials in `config.yaml`.
